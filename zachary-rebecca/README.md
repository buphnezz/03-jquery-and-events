# Project Name   03-jQuery Events

**Author**: Rebecca Prows and Zachary Schumpert
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
We want users to be able to filter articles that pertain to a particular topic(category) by selecting the appropriate topic (category).  We're building it so a user can easily navigate the blog page, which is chalked full awesome info. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
They need to clone the current project to their system, refactor using jQuery, make articles appear and disappear when they select 'author' from the drop down filter.  

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We're using the jQuery library, CSS, HTML and JavaScript.  The user will need to save all the photos to their computer.
